"And on the last step I was dizzy
Because there were stairs in all directions
But I found another door
And through the door there was the attic
Without old clothes
Without a ceiling
Everything had opened wide
Into the jaws of something bigger
And suddenly I saw that I was
Upstairs and outside and freezing on the roof
Finally it had found me
The answer, the feeling, and the truth

That I'm small."

― *The Antlers, Stairs to the Attic*

"I have read the right books 
to interpret your looks 
you were knocking me down 
with the palm of your eye."

That is true, hackers, that is true.
But they cannot help their neighbors;
That's not good, hackers, that's not good."
