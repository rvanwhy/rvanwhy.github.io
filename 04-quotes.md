Song Lyrics

* * *
"I've seen my veins strain to be seen in plastinate noblesse.
Das Kapital continues on well after cell death.
I've seen my hair coiled in the grass of a ditch in Strathcona County.
I've seen the oily underpass where the third search party found me...
So come back down..."

― *Born Gold, Alabaster Body Worlds*

to interpret your looks 
you were knocking me down 
with the palm of your eye"

― *Joanna Newsom*

"My moon, oh my moon
Not even into
Another eternity
Will you stop your lovely orbiting."

"And the other day, this new friend of mine
Said something to me
'Just because something starts differently
Doesn't mean it's worth less'"

― *Peter Bjorn and John, Objects of my affection*

"Hoarders can get piles of money,
That is true, hackers, that is true.
But they cannot help their neighbors;
That's not good, hackers, that's not good."
