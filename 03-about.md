    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I currently live in Chicago persuing a graduate degree in Mathemtics at the University of Chicago. I live with my lovely wife [Kailee Zingler](http://kvzvanwhy.me/) and our rambunctious cat Autumn</p>

<p>In summer 2016 I mentored three students for the University of Chicago REU. I also attended the University of Chicago [Alebraic Topology Summer School](https://math.uchicago.edu/~chicagotopology2/).</p>

<p>In 2016 I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and graduated summa cum laude.
   </p> 

<p>In the summer of 2015 I attended the University of Chicago REU. There I worked under [Professor Benson Farb](https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~farb/). The research I conducted was joint work with [Peter Haine](http://www.mit.edu/~phaine/) about certain spaces of polynomials. You can read my perspective [here](https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2015/REUPapers/VanWhy.pdf).</p>

<p>From 2012 to 2015 I worked as a student software engineer at [IRIS/PASSCAL Instrument Center](https://www.passcal.nmt.edu/). I wrote software that aided in the visualization and
    management of seismological sensor data. I worked on a small team with [Steve Azevedo](https://www.passcal.nmt.edu/users/azevedo) and [Derick Hess](https://www.passcal.nmt.edu/users/dhess). I started work at PASSCAL with the intent of persuing a career in Software Engineering. However, I left my position in order to focus on
    my Mathematics studies.</p>

<p> In 2012 I started school at The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology as a dual Mathematics and Computer Science major. I studied Computer Science for 3 years before finally deciding to leave the field in favor of pure mathematics.</p>

<p>In 2012 I received my high school diploma from from the Albuquerque Institute for Math and Science. It was there I met my wife [Kailee Zingler](http://kvzvanwhy.me/)</p>


<p>When I am not studying math, I enjoy [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), music, tea, and meditation. Here are some of my favorite <a href="quotes.html">quotes</a>.
