    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I am currently studying Mathematics at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. I intend to graduate in May of 2016 and I hope to go on
      to pursue a PhD in pure mathematics. My academic interests include Differential Topology/Geometry and related fields. I have a soft spot for Algebraic
      Topology and Category Theory. I also have interest in Computer Science and programming language theory and regularly attend a functional programming club. 
    </p>
    <p>When I am not studying math, I enjoy Go, music, tea, and meditation. Here are some of my favorite <a href="quotes.html">quotes</a>.
