    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I currently live in Chicago and I am pursuing a graduate degree in Mathematics at Northwestern University. I live with my lovely wife <a href="https://kzingler.github.io/">Kailee Zingler</a></p>

<p> In summer 2017 I mentored three students for the University of Chicago REU. You can read their papers <a href="https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2017">here</a>. In July and August, I attended the <a href="http://sites.math.northwestern.edu/SNAP2017/">2017 Summer Northwestern Analysis Program (SNAP)</a>. I'm in the group photos <a href="http://sites.math.northwestern.edu/SNAP2017/w1.jpg">here</a>, <a href="http://sites.math.northwestern.edu/SNAP2017/w2.jpg">here</a>, and <a href="http://sites.math.northwestern.edu/SNAP2017/w3.jpg">here</a>. In June, I attended the <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~cmnd/programs/cmnd2017/">Thematic Program in Khaler Geometry 2017</a> at Notre Dame University.

<p> In June 2017, I graduated from the University of Chicago's MS-PSD program.

<p>In summer 2016 I mentored three students for the University of Chicago REU. I also attended the University of Chicago <a href="https://math.uchicago.edu/~chicagotopology2/">Alebraic Topology Summer School</a> .</p>

<p>In 2016 I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and graduated summa cum laude from the New Mexico Insitute of Mining and Technology.

<p>In the summer of 2015 I attended the University of Chicago REU. There I worked under <a href="https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~farb/">Professor Benson Farb</a>. The research I conducted was joint work with <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~phaine/">Peter Haine</a> about certain spaces of polynomials. You can read my perspective <a href="https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2015/REUPapers/VanWhy.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>From 2012 to 2015 I worked as a student software engineer at <a href="https://www.passcal.nmt.edu/">IRIS/PASSCAL Instrument Center</a>. I wrote software that aided in the visualization and
    management of seismological sensor data. I worked on a small team with <a href="https://www.passcal.nmt.edu/users/azevedo">Steve Azevedo</a> and <a href="https://www.passcal.nmt.edu/users/dhess">Derick Hess</a>. I started work at PASSCAL with the intent of persuing a career in Software Engineering. However, I left my position in order to focus on
    my Mathematics studies.</p>

<p> In 2012 I started school at The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology as a dual Mathematics and Computer Science major. I studied Computer Science for 3 years before finally deciding to leave the field in favor of pure mathematics.</p>

<p>In 2012 I received my high school diploma from from the Albuquerque Institute for Math and Science. It was there I met my wife <a href="http://kvzvanwhy.me/">Kailee Zingler</a></p>


<p>When I am not studying math, I enjoy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a>, music, tea, and meditation. Here are some of my favorite <a href="quotes">quotes</a>.
