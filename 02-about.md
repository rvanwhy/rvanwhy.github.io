    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I currently live in Princeton and I am pursuing a graduate degree in Mathematics at Princeton University as a transfer student 
	from Northwestern University. At the moment and I am working on my dissertation. My thesis topic is on contact graph 3-manifolds with 
	applications to symplectic 4-manifolds.
	

<p> In the summer of 2021, I moved to Princeton University. I also gave a talk on disk bundle plumbings and lens spaces for the Graduate Student Seminar at Notre Dame.

<p> In the spring of 2021, I attended the <a href="https://gstgc2021.iu.edu/">Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference</a> at Indiana 
University. I also gave a talk on Milnor's Fibration Theorem for the Graduate Student Seminar at Notre Dame. I gave a talk on 
disk bundle plumbings and lens spaces for the Northwestern University Geometry Seminar. <a href="/assets/pdf/disk_bundle_plumbings_and_lens_spaces_2021.pdf">Here are some rough notes</a> for that talk.

<p> In the winter of 2020, I was the TA for two courses on abstract mathematics and proof methods. I also acted as coordinator for the Northwestern 
University Graduate Student Seminar (NUGSS) as well as the Northwestern Graduate Student Symplectic Geometry Seminar. I gave a talk on Milnor's 
Fibration Theorem for NUGSS.

<p> In the fall of 2020, I will be the TA for two courses on Linear Algebra.

<p>In the summer of 2015, I attended the University of Chicago's REU. There I worked under <a href="https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~farb/">Professor Benson Farb</a>. The research I conducted was joint work with <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~phaine/">Peter Haine</a> about certain spaces of polynomials.

<p>From 2012 to 2015, I worked as a student software engineer at <a href="https://www.passcal.nmt.edu/">IRIS/PASSCAL Instrument Center</a>. I wrote software that aided in the visualization and
    management of seismological sensor data. I worked on a small team with <a href="https://www.passcal.nmt.edu/users/azevedo">Steve Azevedo</a> and <a href="https://www.passcal.nmt.edu/users/dhess">Derick Hess</a>. I started work at PASSCAL with the intent of pursuing a career in Software Engineering. However, I left my position in order to focus on
    my Mathematics studies.</p>

<p> In 2012, I started school at The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology as a dual Mathematics and Computer Science major. I studied Computer Science for 3 years before finally deciding to leave the field in favor of pure mathematics.</p>

<p>In 2012, I received my high school diploma from from the Albuquerque Institute for Math and Science.</p>


<p>When I am not studying math, I enjoy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a>, music, tea, and meditation. Here are some of my favorite <a href="quotes">quotes</a>.
