    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I am currently studying Mathematics at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. I intend to graduate in May of 2016 and I hope to go on
      to pursue a PhD in pure mathematics. My academic interests include Algebraic and Differential Geometry, Algebraic Topology, and Category Theory.
      I also have interest in Computer Science and the mathematics behind programming languages. 
    </p>
    <p>When I am not studying math, I enjoy bouldering, music, tea and meditation.
