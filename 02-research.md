<h1>My Research</h1>
<p> My research interests are in symplectic and contact geometry. I work on developing constructions for analyzing 4-dimensional symplectic manifolds and 3-dimensional contact manifolds via differential topology. I am interested in developing tools for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3265">symplectic birational geometry</a> in dimension 4. My work takes inspiration from classical algebraic geometry, low dimensional topology, and complex analytic geometry. 

<p> My dissertation is focused on the theory of contact 3-manifolds associated to symplectic divisors with normal crossings, which are symplectic analogs of normal crossing divisors from algebraic geometry. These contact 3-manifolds arise as the boundaries of regular symplectic neighborhoods of a special class of divisors known as concave divisors. Concave divisors are the symplectic analog of compactifying divisors in projective geometry. I have used my 
study of these manifolds to produce tools for generating interesting examples (of both contact 3-manifolds and symplectic 4-manifolds). With my results, 
I hope to give examples of <u>non-affine symplectic manifolds</u> which are symplectic manifolds that cannot be symplectomorphic to any affine algebraic variety. I am particularly interested in finding <u>exotic non-affine manifolds</u> i.e. symplectic manifolds which are non-affine but are nonetheless diffeomorphic to some affine variety.

<p> While my research focuses are in contact and symplectic structures on low dimensional manifolds, I consider myself a geometer, broadly defined.
