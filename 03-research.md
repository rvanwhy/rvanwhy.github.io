## My Research
<p> My research interests are in symplectic and contact geometry. I work on developing constructions for analyzing 4-dimensional symplectic manifolds and 3-dimensional contact manifolds from the so-called "[flexible perspective](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-13609-3_13)." I am interested in developing tools for what will eventually be known as *birational symplectic geometry*. My work takes inspiration from classical algebraic geometry, low dimensional topology, and complex analytic geometry. 

<p> My thesis has focused on the theory of contact 3-manifolds associated to symplectic divisors with normal crossings, which are symplectic analogs of normal crossing divisors from algebraic geometry.

<p> In my thesis which is still in progress, I study a certain class of contact 3-manifolds which arise as the boundary of symplectic 4-manifolds. With my results, I hope to give examples of *non-affine symplectic manifolds* which are symplectic manifolds that 
cannot be symplectomorphic to any affine algebraic variety. I am particularly interested in finding *exotic non-affine manifolds* i.e. symplectic manifolds which are non-affine but are nonetheless diffeomorphic to some affine variety.

<p> While my research focuses are in contact and symplectic structures on low dimensional manifolds, I consider myself a geometer, broadly defined.
