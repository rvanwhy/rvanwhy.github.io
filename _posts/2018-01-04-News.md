Like many people, I have been burned before by fake news. I've, on more than one occasion, found myself
sharing factually incorrect stories or spouting talking points that were not based in reality. Recently,
I've been a lot more warey about the sources of my news. This blog post outlines the sources I regularly read
and trust.

The following are a list of sources I regularly read and trust. Any stories they run and their contents therein I
treat as fact in absence of any contradictory evidence from other trustworthy sources. I try to read stories from these
as much as possible:

- [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com)
- [The Christian Science Monitor](https://www.csmonitor.com)
- [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com)
- [Associated Press](https://apnews.com)
- [The Economist](https://www.economist.com)

The following are a list of sources I trust but acknowledge their biases:

- [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com)
- [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com)
- [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com)
- [NPR](https://www.npr.org)
- [Politico](https://www.politico.com)
- [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com)

The following are a list of sources that I read sometimes and am often wary of (I won't dignify them with links):

- CNN
- BBC
- ABC News
- MSN
- CBS News
- Time Magazine

For any financial news:

- [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com)
- [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com)

If I have to read a local newspaper for a story, I usually read whichever newspaper is running the story. I usually don't
pay too much attention to the details or commentary and try to remember the main points over all else. I regularly read the
following local papers:

- [The Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com)
- [The Albuquerque Journal](https://www.abqjournal.com)

I use the following fact checkers if I want the details on a story that the sources on my "trustworthy" list are not covering:

- [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com)
- [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com)

For technical news, I usually read whatever [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) throws at me. I also read blogs and
opinion pieces but I almost never repeat their contents as fact. I will share blog posts mainly as thought provokers or in order
to start a discussion.

For some odd reason, I also read the meta news-source [Poynter](https://www.poynter.org). Sometimes I can get a broad overview of how a story is being covered
accross multiple sources. I will only dive into a Poynter article if I am really interested in the story they are discussing. Otherwise,
I tend to just read the headlines.

Some remarks:
-------------

Although I like my news sources to be largely unbiased, I do not consider myself a centrist nor do I value
centrist views. I tend to hold left leaning opinions. I prefer to make my own decisions about how I feel about a topic and
I don't like to read talking points that someone else has thought of for me. However, I do often read the discussions of
these articles that take place on Reddit. These discussions tend to be very left leaning and have definitely influenced my opinion on
more than one occasion. When possible, I like to read original sources (i.e. CBO reports and press releases), but this is not
something I always do.

I realize that putting BBC on the list of sources I am wary of is odd but I have found a bias towards western
culture and influence especially on topics such as world politics and military events. I have a strong suspicion that all english
language news sources have this bias to some extent (even the ones I've labeled "non-biased"). For most world events, I prefer Reuters' reporting;
the tone is often robotic and unfiltered and pretty close to raw facts. Whenever Pariscope or Twitter feeds are available, I like
watch those during world events.

On a typical day, I will read the headlines on Reddit, Hacker News, and Google News in order to get a broad overview. I try to filter out and ignore
most of the headlines that I feel are overly sensational or are run by sources I do not trust (for example: the news subreddit really likes
The Independent
and The Daily Beast for some reason. I almost always ignore their headlines). After I get an idea for what stories are being ran that day, I will
usually turn to sources I trust to get the details. I have, however, found myself entering a discussion
solely with the knowledge of the headline alone. I try very hard not let my news be reduced to just reading headlines, but some days
I do not have the patience to read articles all the way through.
