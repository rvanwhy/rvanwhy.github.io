I recently read Bill Thurston's [On Proof and Progress In Mathematics](http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1994-30-02/S0273-0979-1994-00502-6/S0273-0979-1994-00502-6.pdf).
This essay has a wealth of valuable information for mathematicians, mathematical apoligists, students, and even non-mathematicians. Professor Benson Farb was Bill Thurston's student and based on my personal experiences
with him and reading the above essay, it definitely shows. Benson seems to value the importance of conveying
knowledge clearly and effectively.

Our Bundle
----------
In case my coverage of the background of the problem was not clear or incomplete for some, Emily Riehl has a [nice writeup](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/02/an_emerging_pattern_in_algebra.html#more) on some of the background for the project we've been working on in Benson's group and has given
a great synopsis of the intuition and mathematical background. This time, I'll be talking about a problem we've been dancing around for a while now and our latest vectors for attacking it.

Consider the following chain of homomorphisms:

$$P_n \to B_n \to S_n \to O(n)$$

Where $$P_n \to B_n$$ is the natural inclusion, $$B_n \to S_n$$ is the map that "forgets braiding", $$O(n)$$ is the orthogonal group, and $$S_n \to O(n)$$ is the
[standard representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_the_symmetric_group) of $$S_n$$. These homomorphisms induce maps on their [classifying spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilenberg%E2%80%93MacLane_space).

$$BP_n \to BB_n \to BS_n \to BO(n)$$

If you recall from my blog back in June, the classifying space of $$P_n$$ is $$Conf_n(\mathbb{C})$$ and the classifying space of $$B_n$$ is $$UConf_n(\mathbb{C})$$.
One model of [$$BO(n)$$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifying_space_for_O(n)) is the infinite [Grassmanians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmannian) $$Gr(\mathbb{R^\infty}, n)$$.
Thus our chain of homomorphisms of groups induces the map of spaces via composition:

$$UConf_n(\mathbb{C}) \cong Poly_n(\mathbb{C}) \to Gr(\mathbb{R^\infty}, n)$$

Most rational people would take this as an interesting fact and move on or use it to prove something more interesting. Benson, however, is not just interested in the
*existence* of such a map; He wants answers as to what this map is explicitly (especially in the context of polynomials).
The existence of the above map tells us something: there should be a way to take a degree $$n$$ square-free polynomial and produce a real $$n-$$plane. The interpretation
of this map has proven more difficult than it seems on the surface. We haven't yet worked out the details of the full map (although we're pretty sure we have $$BB_n \to BS_n$$ figured out).

This map, whatever it may be, induces a [vector bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle) on $$Poly_n(\mathbb{C})$$. This vector bundle has been our main interest throughout the
REU. The vector bundle is best understood as the following total space $$E = \{(z_i, x_i) : \{z_i\} \in Poly_n(\mathbb{C}), x_i \in \mathbb{R} \}$$, with the bundle map given by the
obvious projection. Thanks to the brilliant calculation of D.B. Fuks in [this paper](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01094491) we can understand a bit about the bundle
via the theory of [Characteristic Classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_class) specifically with Stiefel-Whitney classes. I might go into the details of this later.

Fuks also gives us a very useful decomposition of $$Poly_n(\mathbb{C})$$ as a [CW-Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complex) which allows us to trivialize the bundle on each cell
giving us a better picture of what the bundle looks like. We are currently in the process of writing down all of the local trivializations but our argument is combinatorial in nature. This might allow us to describe the map $$Poly_n(\mathbb{C}) \to Gr(\mathbb{R^\infty}, n)$$ which has eluded us for so long. I'm not entirely sure if anyone has investigated this bundle in such detail but it should give us some insight into the finer aspects of $$Poly_n(\mathbb{C})$$. Stay tuned.
