The following description more or less outlines what I have been and
plan on studying at the University of Chicago with Professor Benson Farb and his group.
I will try to use this blog to keep track of my progress as the summer goes along.
My current goals of study are a bit more specific than simply looking at this
correspondence and so I will go into more detail as time goes on. This post will
be fairly technical but the results have been highlighted so that most people can
appreciate them.

Let \\(M\\) be a space. The configuration space of \\(n\\) distinct points in the space is defined as
\\[Conf_n(M) = \\{(x_1,...,x_n) | x_i \in M, x_i \neq x_j\\}\\]
In other words, the configuration space of the \\(n\\) distinct points is the number of "positions" that the points
can take in the space without touching each other. Configuration spaces have many applications in other fields like
physics and robotics. We're going to use configuration spaces to explore interesting connections between seemingly unrelated
topics.

There is a natural \\(S_n\\)-action on the configuration space given
by \\\(\sigma(x_1,...,x_n) = (x_{\sigma(1)}, ..., x_{\sigma(n)}),\ \forall \sigma \in S_n \\\)
i.e. the permutation group acts on configurations by permuting the positions of the points. We can define an
equivalence relation on \\(PConf_n(M)\\) by defining two configurations \\(c_1, c_2 \in PConf_n(M)\\) as equivalent if there exists
a permutation in \\(S_n\\) that transforms \\(c_1\\) into \\(c_2\\) and vice versa
(i.e. \\(\exists \sigma \in S_n\ s.t.\ \sigma c_1 = c_2, c_1 = \sigma^{-1} c_2)\\).
One can see that this is indeed an equivalence relation. We denote the quotient space obtained from this relation by:
\\[UConf_n(M) = Conf_n(M)/S_n = \\{lists\ of\ distinct\ points\ x_1,...,x_n\in M\\}\\]

The only difference between \\(Conf_n(M)\\) and \\(UConf_n(M)\\) is that the collections in the old space were ordered
and the collections in the new space are unordered. We'll come back to configuration spaces in a moment. Now, let's consider the
space \\(\mathbb{C}[x]\\) of polynomials over the complex numbers. Let \\(Poly_n(\mathbb{C})\\) denote the subspace of monic, square-free
polynomials (i.e. polynomials of the form \\(p(x) = x^n + a_1x^{n-1} + ... + a_{n-1}x + a_n\\) with \\(n\\) distinct roots).
From here, I can make the following claim:


\\[Poly_n(\mathbb{C}) \cong UConf_n(\mathbb{C})\\]
\\(Proof.\\) Take \\(p \in Poly_n(\mathbb{C})\\). Since \\(\mathbb{C}\\) is algebraically closed, we can assume \\(p(x)\\) is of the form
\\(p = (x - \lambda_1)(x - \lambda_2)...(x - \lambda_n)\\). We construct a map \\(f: Poly_n(\mathbb{C}) \to UConf_n(\mathbb{C})\\) defined
by \\(f(p) = (\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n)\\) with \\(\lambda_i\\) defined as above. This map is unique up to reordering of the \\(\lambda_i\\)
and it is therefore well defined. Since \\(p\\) is square free, we see the image of \\(p\\) indeed lies in \\(UConf_n(\mathbb{C})\\). One can easily check
that this map is bijective. Its inverse \\(f^{-1}: UConf_n(\mathbb{C}) \to Poly_n(\mathbb{C})\\) is given by the map taking unordered
lists \\(c_1 = [\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n] \in Conf_n(\mathbb{C})\\) to the polynomial \\(f^{-1}(c_1) = (x - \lambda_1) ... (x - \lambda_n)\\). \\(\tag*{$\blacksquare$}\\)

With this fact, we have established a connection between distinct unordered points in the complex plane with the space of polynomials over it. The importance of this
correspondence is deeper than it appears on the surface. To discuss why, we must introduce the topic of braid groups. The braid group on \\(n\\) strands (denoted
\\(B_n\\)) is the group
generated by moves like the following:

With the group operation being the obvious braid composition. If you number the points on the left side of the braid, we see that following a strand to the other
end is the same as permuting the numbered left endpoint. Thus we have a natural homomorphism \\(\phi: B_n \to S_n\\) which "forgets" the braiding structure and just treats each braid as a
permutation on \\(n\\)-elements. The kernel of this map is the subgroup of \\(B_n\\) that does not permute the endpoints. i.e. braids like the following:

![Source: Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Braid_s3_inv_squared.png)

We call such braids "pure" braids. The quotient group denoted \\(P_n = B_n/\ker{\phi}\\) is called the "pure braid group" on \\(n\\) strands. From here, I can make the
bold claim about the [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group) of a certain spaces:
\\[\pi_1(Conf_n(\mathbb{C})) \cong B_n\\]
\\[\pi_1(UConf_n(\mathbb{C})) \cong \pi_1(Poly_n(\mathbb{C})) \cong P_n\\]
This says that loops in the configuration space of the complex numbers act like braids. This translates to the world of polynomials by saying that loops in the space of monic
square free polynomials act like pure braids. To see this, we can use the following picture:

![A helpful example]({{site.url}}/assets/loop.png)

The above picture can be thought of as a time slice representing a loop in \\(Conf_n(\mathbb{C})\\) i.e. the horizontal axis are points in the configuration space and the vertical axis is time. The points at the top and bottom represent distinct points ordered from left to right that act as the endpoints of our loop.The braid formed, comes from the the way the points move around each other in the configuration space during the loop. There are formal proofs of this correspondence that make these ideas concrete.

This relationship is even deeper than it seems. As it turns out, the higher [homotopy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_group) of \\(Poly_n(\mathbb{C})\\) are trivial making \\(Poly_n(\mathbb{C})\\) the [classification space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilenberg%E2%80%93MacLane_space) of the pure braid group. Thus the [cohomologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomology) of the pure braid group directly correspond to the cohomologies of \\(Poly_n(\mathbb{C})\\). We now have some very powerful tools for studying polynomials and the braid group gives us a convenient way to do so. This correspondence was very surprising to me and is a very exciting topic to discuss.
